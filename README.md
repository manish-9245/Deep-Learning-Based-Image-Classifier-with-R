# Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Classifier-with-R
Training the deep learning-based image classification model on the Fashion MNIST dataset which contains 70000 grayscale images of clothes across 10 categories, using Keras interface in R with Tensor Flow at its backend. This project involves Building, Training, and Evaluating the Neural Network Model.
